If you're an add-on developper, you may hate anki's database. It's totally unreadable. It's hard to get a direct access in it to debug  it.
Because configuration is saved in a json string. Because fields and tags are saved as concatenated text.
Thus, this add-on's only purpose is to help correct all of this. It allow to do mostly two things. Transform anki's database into a more readable one. And transform this readable database into a anki database.
